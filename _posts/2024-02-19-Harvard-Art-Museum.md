## **Objects of Interest**
The Harvard Art Museum [website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/) features a diverse range of artworks from various historical periods and cultures. Each piece tells a unique story, enriching our understanding of art's evolution and its global impact. With detailed descriptions, it's a rich resource for art enthusiasts and scholars alike to explore and appreciate visual culture. While browsing through various websites using specific keywords related to artworks of interest, I stumbled upon a few intriguing pieces. 

One captivating piece I found was [*The Virgin with the Sleeping Christ Child*](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299919) by Orazio Gentileschi, circa 1610. Gentileschi skillfully conveys the sacramental meaning of Christ’s birth while foreshadowing his eventual sacrifice. The painting portrays the Child sleeping in the Virgin’s lap, symbolizing the solemnity of his future death. Notably, the Child holds an apricot, representing the forbidden fruit and alluding to the original sin that Christ's eventual sacrifice will redeem. Against a dark void, the figures are dramatically illuminated, inviting reflection on the intertwined themes of birth, mortality, and redemption.

Naturally, I was drawn to search for representations of my nationality, and thus, I found [*Kaaba Style Shama*](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/58463?position=1&context=person&id=24287) among the results when I searched for Ghanaian artworks on the Harvard Art Museum website. Captured by Philip Kwame Apagya, a Ghanaian photographer born in Sekondi, Ghana, in 1958, this photograph from 1996 offers a captivating glimpse into Ghanaian culture and aesthetics. The title "Kaaba Style Shama" hints at a connection to Islamic traditions, particularly the Kaaba in Mecca, which holds significant religious importance in Islam. Apagya's portrayal of this cultural fusion reflects the diverse influences and intersections found within Ghanaian society, offering not only a visual representation but also an introspective journey into my own heritage and identity.
