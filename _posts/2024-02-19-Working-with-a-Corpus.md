## **THE AVENGERS CORPUS**

### Understanding Text Analysis and Choosing the Corpus**

Text analysis is the process of examining and understanding written or spoken language to gain insights and extract meaning from it. It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze the structure, content, and context of a text.
In line with this approach, I have selected all four texts from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): "The Avengers" (2012), "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015), "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018), and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019). Obtaining these texts involved directly downloading the SRT subtitle files for each movie from [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en)opensubtitles.org, a trusted source for subtitle files. After acquiring the SRT files, I utilized the transcription tool provided by [happyscribe.org](https://www.happyscribe.com/) to convert them into TXT format, ensuring that the TXT format easily integrates with the digital textual analysis tools to be used for this assignment.
The decision to include all four Avengers movies in the corpus comes from an intentional choice to provide a comprehensive exploration of the narrative landscape, character dynamics, and thematic intricacies inherent within the MCU. Each film represents a significant chapter in the overarching saga, contributing unique story arcs while interconnecting through common themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of justice. By encompassing the entirety of the Avengers series, this corpus offers an expansive canvas for conducting exploratory data analysis and going into the textual nuances that define the cinematic universe.
Through the analysis of these texts, I aim to unravel the linguistic patterns and thematic motifs that are used in the Avengers narrative across multiple cinematic installments. By actively scrutinizing the textual content of "The Avengers," "Avengers: Age of Ultron," "Avengers: Infinity War," and "Avengers: Endgame," I seek to unearth insights into the evolution of storytelling and character development within the MCU.
