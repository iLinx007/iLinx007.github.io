## Course Reflection

As a 22-year-old student majoring in Computer Science at New York University Abu Dhabi, my journey through the realm of digital literacy has been both exhilarating and challenging. In this reflection, I'll delve into my experiences, strategies, and aspirations within the field of computer science and how digital literacy shapes my academic and daily life.

In my academic pursuits, I find myself constantly engaged in various aspects of digital literacy, focusing primarily on problem-solving, data analysis, and software development rather than content creation. While some of my peers may excel in content creation, my strengths lie in coding projects, algorithmic thinking, and collaborating with peers on complex technical challenges. Through platforms like GitHub, I engage in collaborative coding efforts, contributing to shared projects and learning from others in the community. 

Digital literacy, for me, extends beyond creating content to encompass critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability. As a computer science major, I'm not just learning how to write code; I'm developing computational thinking skills that enable me to tackle intricate problems and devise innovative solutions. This mindset empowers me to approach challenges with a systematic and analytical mindset, breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks and iteratively refining my solutions.

Moreover, collaboration plays a pivotal role in enhancing my digital literacy skills. Through group projects and hackathons, I have the opportunity to work alongside peers from diverse backgrounds, including Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Business, and Literature. These interdisciplinary collaborations not only broaden my perspective but also foster creativity and innovation. By combining insights from different disciplines, we can develop more holistic solutions that address real-world challenges.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, staying abreast of new developments and emerging trends is paramount. As such, I actively seek out opportunities for professional development and lifelong learning. Whether it's attending workshops on machine learning or exploring online courses on cybersecurity, I'm committed to expanding my knowledge and skill set to remain competitive in the field.

Recently, I've been focusing on expanding my toolkit by learning new technologies. I have a strong proficiency in programming languages such as Python and C++, which have served as the foundation of my technical expertise. However, recognizing the importance of staying versatile in a dynamic field like computer science, I recently embarked on a journey to learn React, a JavaScript library commonly used for building user interfaces. This experience has allowed me to delve into the realm of frontend development, explore modern web development techniques, and integrate React into my projects to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

As I reflect on my journey, I acknowledge that there are areas where I hope to improve and grow in terms of digital literacy. While I have developed proficiency in certain programming languages and technologies, I recognize the value of continuous learning and adaptation in a field characterized by rapid innovation. Moving forward, I aspire to deepen my understanding of advanced concepts in computer science, master additional programming languages and frameworks, and hone my skills in areas such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and software engineering.

To achieve these goals, I have adopted various strategies for enhancing my digital literacy skills and achieving my learning objectives. I set aside dedicated time for self-study and practice, seek out mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals, participate in online communities and forums to share knowledge and collaborate with peers, and attend workshops and training programs to stay updated with the latest developments and advancements in the field.

In conclusion, digital literacy is a multifaceted skill set that encompasses technical proficiency, critical thinking, and adaptability. As a computer science major, I am grateful for the opportunities to hone my digital literacy skills and contribute to the advancement of technology and society. With dedication, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning, I look forward to shaping the future of computing and making a meaningful difference in the world. Through continuous exploration and collaboration, I aspire to expand my knowledge and expertise in digital literacy, pushing the boundaries of innovation and contributing to positive societal change.


### Part 2

Before enrolling in this course, I primarily had basic digital literacy skills. While I could navigate common software applications like word processors and spreadsheets proficiently, my understanding of data analysis and visualization tools was limited. However, this course has broadened my digital literacy skills significantly by introducing me to a wide range of tools and techniques. Particularly enlightening has been learning to use tools such as Voyant and Antconc for text analysis, providing insights I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. Additionally, I learned MATLAB during Love Data Week, and this early exposure has made the project I am currently working on with CTED relatively easier to undertake.

In my first assignment, I delved into the digital collections of the Harvard Art Museum to explore the evolving landscape of art curation and appreciation in the digital age. Initially tasked with assessing the museum's website interface for accessibility and user experience, I discovered a notably user-friendly platform. Working through, I shifted my focus to the Posit cloud, a repository containing extensive metadata on each artwork. Utilizing Python scripts, I conducted a comparative analysis between the presentation of artworks on the museum's website and their depiction in the Posit cloud. This analysis illuminated the advantages of digital tools in unveiling connections between artworks that may not be immediately apparent through traditional viewing methods. Furthermore, leveraging blocks of Python code, I conducted a detailed examination of the museum's collection data, with a specific emphasis on the visibility and engagement with artworks from British, Chinese, and Indian cultures. Through this process, I gleaned valuable insights into public interest and the digital accessibility of art within the museum's collection. This hands-on application of digital humanities methodologies not only enriched my understanding of the intersection between technology and art but also highlighted the transformative potential of digital tools in democratizing art history, making it more accessible and engaging for a broader audience.

In this course, Iâ€™ve also explored AI's impact across disciplines: ethics in computer science, storytelling in literature, climate change in environmental studies, and market analysis in business. This course has been eye-opening, bridging tech and the humanities, making me adept at digital concepts.
